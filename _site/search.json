What is your research question?\nIn the project, the question we are examining is how does work hours, study hours, if taking calculus and economics (in high school), and quiz scores affect the college student’s overall course score in economics.\n2. What is your dependent variable which are candidates for independent variables?\nOur dependent variable is the student’s course score (score). Our independent variables are: hours worked per week (work), hours studying per week (study), if economics was taken in high school (econhs), if calculus was taken in high school (calculus), and math quiz score (mathscr).\n3. Why do you think the independent variables are correlated with the independent variables?In which direction (positive or negative do you expect the independent variables to influence the dependent variables?\nFor students working more hours, it will negatively affect the student’s course score because they are working more than they are studying.\nFor students studying more, it will positively affect the student’s course score because they are putting in more hours to study the material.\nIf economics and calculus were taken in high school, it will positively increase the student’s course score because they have previous knowledge on the class material.\nThe math quiz score will positively increase the student’s course score because the math quiz contributes to their overall score."

We still found that the variables with the correct coefficient signs and p-values are hours worked, math quiz score and calc.\nHours Worked\n\nModelDesignLinear=linear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n\nRecipeDataeconmath=recipe(Dataeconmath, course_score~hours_worked)\nWFModelAll=workflow() %&gt;% \n  add_recipe(RecipeDataeconmath) %&gt;% \n  add_model(ModelDesignLinear) %&gt;% \n  fit(Dataeconmath)\n\ntidy(WFModelAll)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term         estimate std.error statistic     p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    74.7      0.621     120.   0          \n2 hours_worked   -0.244    0.0491     -4.97 0.000000826\n\nglance(WFModelAll)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic     p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC\n      &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    0.0282        0.0270  13.2      24.7 0.000000826     1 -3413. 6831. 6845.\n# ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nHours Studied\n\nModelDesignLinear=linear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n\nRecipeDataeconmath=recipe(Dataeconmath, course_score~hours_studied)\nWFModelAll=workflow() %&gt;% \n  add_recipe(RecipeDataeconmath) %&gt;% \n  add_model(ModelDesignLinear) %&gt;% \n  fit(Dataeconmath)\n\ntidy(WFModelAll)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term          estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    72.4       0.940     77.0     0    \n2 hours_studied   0.0161    0.0589     0.274   0.785\n\nglance(WFModelAll)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC\n      &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.0000879      -0.00109  13.4    0.0748   0.785     1 -3425. 6856. 6870.\n# ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nCalc\n\nModelDesignLinear=linear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n\nRecipeDataeconmath=recipe(Dataeconmath, course_score~calc)\nWFModelAll=workflow() %&gt;% \n  add_recipe(RecipeDataeconmath) %&gt;% \n  add_model(ModelDesignLinear) %&gt;% \n  fit(Dataeconmath)\n\ntidy(WFModelAll)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    67.7      0.781     86.7  0       \n2 calc            7.20     0.950      7.58 9.12e-14\n\nglance(WFModelAll)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic  p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC\n      &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    0.0632        0.0621  13.0      57.4 9.12e-14     1 -3397. 6800. 6814.\n# ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nEconhs\n\nModelDesignLinear=linear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n\nRecipeDataeconmath=recipe(Dataeconmath, course_score~Econhs)\nWFModelAll=workflow() %&gt;% \n  add_recipe(RecipeDataeconmath) %&gt;% \n  add_model(ModelDesignLinear) %&gt;% \n  fit(Dataeconmath)\n\ntidy(WFModelAll)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)   72.9       0.579   126.      0    \n2 Econhs        -0.813     0.952    -0.855   0.393\n\nglance(WFModelAll)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC\n      &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  0.000858     -0.000316  13.4     0.731   0.393     1 -3424. 6855. 6869.\n# ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;"

As soon as I got my driving permit my father will have me as a chauffeur going to at least 7 body shops in LA every day on the summer 2018. He is Senior Account Manager and I got to see my father interact with Body Shop owners and saw how Body Shop owners ran their businesses each more differently than the next. Different people meant different cultures, needs, and ways they run there business.\nMy father’s relationships with his customers were more personal than professional, there I realized sales is more than just products and services but going the extra mile to keep a person’s business. In this the people business is the side of the business that not everyone comprehends unless they are going that extra mile for there clients. He was always proactive and going the extra mile for new and current business, these are the values I stuck with and has helped me beyond my personal and professional career.\nWhat I learned with him was how to build relationships, maintaining relationships, going the extra mile, and people.\nI met so many Body Shop owners during this time and have close relationships with some since they saw me as a child. I actually worked at a family friend’s shop, Bellwood Auto Body, in Bell Gardens for 1 Month in the Summer 2019.\n\n\n\nBellwood Auto Body, Bell Gardens"

The company already filed for bankruptcy at the time so half of my time in this role was closing the store and liquidating assets.\nSales, Customer Service, and Productivity are the strong traits I carry since I like meeting new customers and helping them with their needs at the store. For me it was always important to always be doing something as my mindset has been, ” Someone is always watching”. As the store came to a complete close, management wanted me to transfer with them to the Whitter location however my heaviest semester at Community College was coming up and I did not want to comprise my GPA for a job, so I declined and moved on focused on finishing my associates.\nWhat I learned was customer service, patience, productivity, and putting previous sales techniques to practice.\n\n\n\nSears, Plaza West Covina"

My responsibility was to collect feedback from customers through QR codes on store receipts, maintain a better average than the stores around the area, and resolve customer disputes on okta which is what the store used for it’s operations.\nAs a franchise well-known value is customer service and the infamous ” My Pleasure” training associates during the closing shift was a responsibility that was passed down to me. New associates constantly needed training as QSR turnover rate is high.\nAs I passed a year of employment, My last semester at California State University of Fullerton was a heavy spring schedule and a summer semester of 2 classes. I put my 2 weeks in to focus final semesters of my bachelor’s.\nWhat I learned was going beyond listed responsibilities, learning and development, leadership, and maintaining a positive profit rate through the hours of the day.\n\n\n\nChick-fil-A, The Shops at Santa Anita\n\n\nMy second role in QSR was at a support center for Panda Restaurant Group. My last 2 Months in college I was very lucky to obtain the role of Learning & Development while in the last weeks of my degree. This was a unique opportunity and I learned so much from this role, supervisors, and team members.\nSee I was always quiet in seated environments, most of my education journey was spent in the library finishing assignments and leaving when the library closed. I have customer service & leadership skills but not personal communication skills were I can use to network with colleagues. It can be hard to believe but I could not even look at people in the eyes when walk past them I just kept my head down. I always performed my duties and exceeded expectations however the socializing aspect of the job I struggled\nMy supervisor was able to get me outside of this comfort zone and it helped me tremendously. I was able to have conversations with people and maintain eye contact without sweating. I was able to speak up and take the lead in an employee benefit project. which lead to a mini email marketing campaign to regional and area leaders in operations. As well as create and maintain our internal community discussion forums.\nWhat I learned was Interpersonal Skills, Project Management, Group Collaboration, Administrative Work, and Networking.\n\n\n\nPanda Restaurant Group Support Center, Rosemead"
