What quantitative effect of an increase of the independent variable?**   \nConsidering our data, it is reasonable for us to conclude that a higher quiz score and having taken a Calculus course would positively influence a student’s course score in Economics, while hours worked would negatively impact their course score. After running the regression, we know that with if our independent variables increase by 1 unit, our dependent variable will also increase by 1 unit as they are directly correlated. Additionally, if our independent variable was a negative value, it would cause our dependent variable to decrease by an equal amount. The correlation between the independent and dependent variables implies meaningful association between them.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# **Introduction** \n\n**1.
